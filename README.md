## Usage

Run agent on 100 original SMB chunks: `python test_loop.py org`

Run agent on 100 VAE-generated SMB chunks: `python test_loop.py org`

Run agent on 100 (under-fitting) GMM-generated SMB chunks: `python test_loop.py gmm-[components]`

- Components to choose from: [  8,  28,  48,  68,  88, 108, 128]

- E.g., `python test_loop.py gmm-128`

Run agent on 100 (best-fitting) GMM-generated SMB chunks: `python test_loop.py gmm-optim`

The playability proportion (the number of chunks passable / the total number of chunks) is printed at the end after the agent has tried traversing all 100 chunks.

## Pygame Compatibility

My Python version is 3.6.9 and my Pygame vesion is 2.0.0.dev3.

You can update your Pygame to this version using: `pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev3`
